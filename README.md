Final Year Project for my Computer Science Degree at the University of Reading

- [Production site](https://selenium-web-tester-prd.herokuapp.com/)
- [Development site](https://selenium-web-tester-dev.herokuapp.com/)

This site aims to make testing using selenium much easier. The site allows users to create selenium scripts declaratively and have them executed by a selenium server, and have the results returned to them.

Base code taken from [here](https://www.codementor.io/nodejs/tutorial/build-website-from-scratch-using-expressjs-and-bootstrap) and heavily modified.
